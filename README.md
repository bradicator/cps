Some data visualization for Chicago Public Schools' (CPS) English and Math test scores ([see IAR and PARCC tests here](https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/assessment-reports/)).

Main results are in the pdf files. `N` is the number of students in each grade. Number in each cell is the percent of students who **met or exceed** grade-level expectation or **exceed** expectation (depending on file name). Plots are arranged in descending 2023 mean score. Year 2020's data is missing and is imputed as the average the same cohort's score in 2019 and 2021.
